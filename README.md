# Genetic Flappy Bird

Hello, I spent another week of the sommer vacation to play around with Kotlin. In this project I used the language to teach a network how to play Flappy Bird. The working principle is very simple.

First of all, tt would not be accurate to say that ONE neural network learned to play this game. A better description would be "Many neural networks attempt to play this game and I chose the best of them in each generation and let them reproduce". 

Each generation the fitness of a population of birds will be evaluated by how far a bird can fly. The sensors of each birds give its brain information of the environment. 

The brain itself returns control signal determines if the bird shall jump or not. Generations pass and the birds becoming better and better playing the game.

## Results

##### Neural network with no hidden layer. Only an input layer and an output layer.

The brain capacity of each bird is very small and the population has great difficulty to learn to survive.

##### Neural network with one hidden layer. 

With already one more brain layer, the fittest bird can already beats the game after a few generations, achieving the immortality status.

## Implementation

The algorithm is simple:
- Initialize a population of 15 birds. Each bird has a random brain with random parameters. A brain would look like following

<img src="data/network.png" width="450"></img>

Each parameter ``Wij`` will be generated randomly at the beginning. The input is the current velocity of the bird, distance 
between the bird and the next pipes, the location of the next pipes, etc. The last neuron of the network will indicates for each input
if the bird should jump.

Of course at the beginning, the brain's performance will be very bad. However, some are less worse than others.

- In the next step, the fitness of each brain will be evaluated. The fittest have a greater chance of reproduce and mating with 
other brains. To keep the gene pool diverse, some kind of mutation will be done like ``Wij +- eps``.

- After a while, the population's performance will become better and better.
